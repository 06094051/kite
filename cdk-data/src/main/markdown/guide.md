# CDK Data Reference Guide

## Overview of the Data Module

The CDK Data module is a set of APIs for interacting with datasets in the
Hadoop ecosystem. Specifically built to simplify direct reading and writing
of datasets in storage subsystems such as the Hadoop Distributed FileSystem
(HDFS), the Data module provides familiar, stream-oriented APIs,
that remove the complexity of data serialization, partitioning, organization,
 and metadata system integration.

## About This Guide

This reference guide is the primary source of documentation for the Data
module. It covers the high level organization of the APIs,
primary classes and interfaces, intended usage, available extension points
for customization, and implementation information where helpful and
appropriate.

From here on, this guide assumes you are already familiar with the basic
design and functionality of HDFS, Hadoop MapReduce, and Java SE 1.6. Users
who are also familiar with [Avro][avro], data serialization techniques,
common compression algorithms (e.g. gzip, snappy), advanced Hadoop MapReduce
topics (e.g. input split calculation), and tranditional data management
topics (e.g. partitioning schemes, metadata management) will benefit even more.

## What's New

### Version 0.1.0

Version 0.1.0 is the first release of the CDK Data module. This is considered
 a *beta* release. As a sub-1.0.0 release, this version is *not* subject to
 the normal API compatibility guarantees. See the *Compatibility Statement*
 for information about API compatibility guarantees.

## Appendix

### Compatibility Statement

As a library, users must be able to reliably determine the intended
compatibility of this project. We take API stability and compatibility
seriously; any deviation from the stated guarantees is a bug. This project
follows the guidelines set forth by the [Semantic Versioning
Specification][semver] and uses the same nomenclature.

Just as with CDH (and the Semantic Versioning Specification), this project makes
the following compatibility guarantees:

1. The patch version is incremented if only backward-compatible bug fixes are
   introduced.
1. The minor version is incremented when backward-compatible features are added
   to the public API, parts of the public API are deprecated, or when changes
   are made to private code. Patch level changes may also be included.
1. The major version is incremented when backward-incompatible changes are made.
   Minor and patch level changes may also be included.
1. Prior to version 1.0.0, no backward-compatibility is guaranteed.


    1.2.3
    ^ ^ ^
    | | |
    | | +- patch (or micro) version
    | +--- minor version
    +----- major version

See the [Semantic Versioning Specification][semver] for more information.

Additionally, the following statements are made:

* The public API is defined by the Javadoc.
* Some classes may be annotated with @Beta. These classes are evolving or
  experimental, and are not subject to the stated compatibility guarantees. They
  may change incompatibly in any release.
* Deprecated elements of the public API are retained for two releases and then
  removed. Since this breaks backward compatibility, the major version must also
  be incremented.
