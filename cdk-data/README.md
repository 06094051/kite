# Cloudera Development Kit - Data Module

The Data Module is a collection of APIs that drastically simplify working with datasets
in the Hadoop filesystems (such as HDFS).

This project is part of the Cloudera Development Kit (CDK), an open source
set of APIs that helps developers build robust systems and applications
with CDH and Cloudera Manager.
